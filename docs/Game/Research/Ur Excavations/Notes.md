There seems to be some contention about what to call periods of Sumer's history

_Ur Excavations_ uses the terminology Archaic I, Archaic II, Archaic III, and Archaic IV. 

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314178299_somewhat_smaller_and_shallower_-_The_development_of_Conical_Bowls_in_third_millennium_Mesopotamia says that Archaic III was the Jemer Nasr period, and Archaic IVa was Late Uruk. It appears that lower numbers are closer to us (bleh)

The Early Dynastic Period IIIa would probably be in the Archaic I, then? Plate 66 of Us Excavations V says that Archaic I was the First Dynasty of Ur. 

I need to get a good handle on the chronology

## Volume I - Royal Inscriptions

Item U.8981, publication number 268, translated on page 71, is from Mes-Anepada, the second king of the First Dynasty "NIN-TUR-NIN, wife of Measnnipadda". Woolley is uncertain whether ninturnun is a name or a title. Perhaps future work found out? The inscription was found on a lapiz lazuli cylinder depicting fighting animals

## Volume IV - The Early Period

Plates 71, 72, 73, 76, 77, 78, 82, and 83 show cross-sections of the soil in the pits Woolley dug around the Tenemos enclosure. 83 compares all the pits

The holy area was about 12 meters above sea level at the time of the first dynasty. It may have been as low as 10 in some places, uncertain

I'll have to compare with the levels in the residential area where Ea-Nasir lived

The area in the south of the Tenemos wall appears to have been an active cemetery for many centuries. Surely there's some buildings marking the graves of early kings?

## Volume V - The Ziggurat and its Surroundings

Our temple is shown on Plate 66, I believe. Woolley has drawn out what he believes to be the walls during the first dynasty, and has sketches wher ehe assumes the ziggurat of that time would have been. Since it's completely covered by the Great Ziggurat I'll ahve to use artistic license to portray it

### Chapter I

The ziggurat terrace was used as such in earlier periods than mine. The buildings sat on a terrace, which was held back by a retaining wall. This wall was at least 2.2 meters tall, and was likely originally taller. It was cut back to make space for later constructions. The wall was built of mud brick 

The ground level on the outside was 0.6 meters below the foundations of the wall? The ground on the inside was two meters higher than on the outside. By the First Dynasty the ground inside the wall was waised 0.9 meters, but the ground outside had risen by two meters! There was less than a meter of difference in the First Dynasty, I suppose

Woollney speculates that the Nannar coutyard existed in this time, but he found no evidence to hint at its size

The north-northwest building inside the ziggurat terrace had a furnace in its center - was this for actual metalworking, or food preparation, or another task?

The buildings in the Archaic II period seem to generally match the buildings in the First Dynasty, with the First Dynasty buildings being a bit larger. One can imagine Mesannepada rebuilding the temple for the glory of Nanna

Woolley found clay cones for "the wall mosaic", as if that's something I should know about? Maybe another work explains it. Woolley points us to Ur Excavations, vol. iv

### Chapter II

The ziggurat of the First Dynasty lies completely beneath the Great Ziggurat, Woolley wisely chose to not destroy the Great Ziggurat. Perhaps there's records of the First Dynasty ziggurat's construction that give hints as to its character? Or perhaps I should just try to make something cool

The wall enclosing the ziggurat terrace was likely thicker on the south-west than is shown in Woolley's drawing, but it was destroyed by Ur-Nammu and thus we cannot be certain. I'd assume that all walls have facing like the northwest wall, and that all are about the same thickness, because that appeals to my aesthetic sensibilities

The wall is built of plano-convex bricks measuring 0.21 m. x 0.14 m. x 0.07 m. and 0.25 m. x 0.17-0.19 m. x0.08 m. The face of this wall was sometimes covered in clay, and there was a masking-wall of limestone rubble. This was 0.6 - 0.7 meters thick, had six or seven courses reaching 1.1 meters high. This formed a foundation for the mud-brick retaining wall, and limestone foundations are seen at other First Dynasty sites. The wall as a whole was plastered with clay, hiding the limestone - and since the limestone was too small to serve a structural purpose, Woolley thinks it may have been a ritual tradition. 

For my purposes, the retaining wall was faced with clay - I need not represent the complexities of plano-convex bricks atop rough-hewn limestone

There may have been other walls in the north, enclosing more space? Woolley thinks that unlikely due to the placement of the limestone

The ground outside the south-east wall of the ziggurat enclosure was the same height as the ground inside. There were no remainins of buttresses, but there was obvious water damage so we can't be certain of the original shape

The passageways likely had "whitewashed" floors. Not entirely sure what that means. Was it powdered limestone mixed with water and let to dry?

The passageways in the south-east likely had hinged doors, possibly with copper hinges?

The eastmost chamber had a whitewashed floor, and a red copper floor a little higher that was built a bit after. There was an alter made of mud bricks, covered in bitumen. Bitumen appears pretty shiny - good chance for me to show off reflections

Woolley found clay sling bullets and slings in the southwest chambers, implying that the ziggurat enclosure had defensive purposes as well as religious

## Volume VI - Buildings of the Third Dynasty

### Chapter X

The river Euphrates ran to the southeast of the city, and the northeastern water was an artificial canal. The northern harbour certainly was man-made, with some of the city wall enclosing it. The southern harbor likely was as well. There seemed to be no buildings close to the southern harbor, and the area around it may have been paved. There was a mud brick wall lining the southern harbor, probably with a burnt brick facade. The city wall that enclosed the southern harbor was entierly brick, with straight sides, while the northern harbor had a dirt enclosure. One might speculate that these different methods of construction imply different times of construction, and the north harbor seems to be a lowering of already-low ground

The walls we have were build in the Third Dynasty by Ur-Nammu. Surely there were walls here before, if only to keep the tell from eroding away? But whatever was once there was either removed or burried in the Third Dynasty, and I'm not sure Woolley had the heart to destroy it

There seem to have been houses built along the top of the wall. "Wall" is osmewhat ambiguous here. Does Woollney mean that houses were built on top of a retaining wall, and that they formed an extra defense by their very presence? Where they above the street level? But he mentioned that in some places (the temple or Enki) the streets come right out to the edge of the walls. Seems that the houses themselves were the walls, and perhaps they had ramparts on their roofs? These houses were 10 - 12 meters back from the edge in most places, one wonders why. Did the kings of Ur expect to field calvary to push back intruders? Did they want an obbious place to show off their patrols? Leaving your defenders unprotected seems unwise. Was larger weaponry stationed here?

Woolley found a few places where thing shad been added to the wall, either repairs or expansions. One might imagine towers and guardhouses here, but little trace of them remains

Woolley thinks that there was a canal from the north harbor to the south, angling along the Tenemos wall. One wonders when such a canal would have been built. Do we have records of that? When Nebercanezur built the tenemos wall, did he build it around the canal? Or was the canal built after?

### Chapter XI

The Third Dynasty wall was perhaps two meters tall in most places? Perhaps three. Given that Ur was on a mound a few meters above sea level, massive walls were probably not necessary

Square MM 34 had walls about three meters above the water line, one may assume a similar height in the First Dynasty? Of course, there'd be less filled-in land, the  Persian Gulf would have been closer to the city, and the tell would have been lower... Volume IV suggests that the tell was about 10 - 12 meters above sea level in the First Dynasty. Do we know how high the water was above sea level?

Plate 60 provides a contour map of the site in the present day, plate 61 contains a sketch of the Third Dynasty buildings with a nice grid.
