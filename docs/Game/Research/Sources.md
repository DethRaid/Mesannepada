"The Early Dynastic period is preceded by the Uruk period (c. 4000 – c. 3100 BCE) and the Jemdet Nasr period (c. 3100 – c. 2900 BCE). The Early Dynastic period (c. 2900 – c. 2350 BCE) is followed by the rise of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2350 – c. 2154 BCE)."

Middle Chronology seems to be more accepted?

There was a league of cities - Umma, Lagash, Uruk, Nippur, Adab. Kish may have been a member, they would serve as a mediator in some conflicts. 

"Lugal" was the word for the king of Ur. The king of Lagash was called "Ensi", the king of Uruk was "EN". Lugal translates as "big man", and could refer to a property owner or the head of a household. It seems to have gained more kingly connotations as ED went on. We can just use Lugal without defining it and people will understand that it's the title of the king

Notes: The gods lived in specially constructed temples, but access to these temples was limited. Maybe the inner sanctum held the god and only the priests were allowed in. People would make statues of themselves to be used to worship. The statues have been found burried in the ground or collected onto altars. These statues were carved from limestone of gypsum. They depict people wearing fleece clothing - skirts for the men, dresses for the women. Men are usually bald or have braids, women have a variety of hairstyles. Faces are pretty consistent across all statues. The statues varied greatly in quality, suggesting that anyone who could afford it would buy a statue to offer their prayers to the gods

SCULPTURE OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. from Tell Asmar and Khafajah - Frankfort 1939.pdf

Discovery of those statues! Nearly 100 years ago. The paper opens saying that there's been no discoveries of connections between dcrude prehistoric carvings and these statues - which is likely no longer true

Notes that the cultural development was influenced by its neighbors - "semicivilized" people, likely meaning "they didnt' live in cites and didn't have writing". Speculates that a lot of cultural developments were spread from Egypt to Sumeria and back again, or from the indus Valley civilizations! I gotta explore that conneciton and see if I can use any of it

"Our understanding of the phenomenon of art itself is bound to grow wider and deeper when a pre-Greek school other than the Egyptian becomes thoroughly known." "This singular achievement of Greece cannot be undone" Really shows how the author viewed the world. I gotta wonder how the development in art in China or Japan compares to this focus. What about the Mayans?

This paper contains sketches of the floor plans of the temples at the site the excavated. Might be good reference material

"The room with the bench (Q 42:7) would in that case have been a storeroom for those statues which were not placed in the immediate presence of the god-for want of space, or because their donors lacked sufficient means or importance, or because the donors' descendants had failed to continue the requisite contributions. For we know from the inscriptions on Gudea's statues (see below) that definite offerings were instituted when one of his statues was set up in the temple, and a similar, if more modest, arrangement must have been made by commoners or officials who could afford to have their effigies made and placed in the temple"

So, people created these statues to petition the god-statue and gave an offering to the temple. If the offering was big enough, their statues would be placed with the god-statue itself - otherwise they'd be placed into a storeroom. Eventually the statues would break, or they'd need to be removed for another reason. They'd be buried somewhere on temple grounds. While most of the buried statues were either broken or deteriorated, one group showed almost no signs of wear. Those statues must have been buried soon after their creation

We can imagine a priest taking the statues of people who only paid for a few months of time and cerimonially burying them before taking in some statues from a richer petitioner, but I'm not sure there's facts that point directly at this interpretation

The paper again mentions that no monumental scultured from the Jemdet Nasr or Early Dynastic I periods have been found, which indicated that they had little material wealth. We first saw freestanding monumental stone scultures in ED II, by ED IIIa there'd probably be a bunch all over. TODO: Find a peper to confirm this

The statues largely have one kind of clothing for men and another for women, with no distinctions for wealth or status. The skirt is called kaunake. This was a skirt, possibly tassled, made of a material close to wool or fleece. Some carvings suggest it was a thin material, others suggest the skirts were cut, at least at the bottom, to allow more freedom of movement. Some skirts are tassled, some are not - is this different material, or the same material worh another way? Are these carvings meant to represent reality directly or are they more of a stylization?

Press release from the German Archeological Institute about uncovering a boar statue at Gobekli Tepe. How does this fit into Frankenfort's theories about the development of art? Perhaps the forces that led to this statue died out before Jemet Nasr

Mesannepada was called the king of Kish. Why?

Two translations of the Hymn to Inanna, composed by Enheduanna (Sargon of Akkad's daughter, high priestess of Nanna). Notable in that it says Inanna could change man to woman, and woman to man - among other things

Some context for the Hymn of Inanna

https://www.penn.museum/sites/bulletin/2583/
Blurb about al-Ubaid. The temple there was build by A'annepada, who claimed to be the sun of Mesannepada but was forgotten by the Sumerian Kings List. The temple at Ur may have been similar?

This site claims the temple was built in 2700 BCE. If Mesannepada ruled in 2500 BCE, and A'annepada rules in 2350 BCE, and A'annepada was his son, and A'annepada built the temple - at least two of these dates are wrong! Maybe I focus less on the exact date and more on the cause and effect

The temple at al-Ubaid was covered in friezes showing people milking cattle and making butter. The temple was dedicated to Nin-Khursag, the mother goddess presiding over farms and cattle, whose milk nourished the king. The friezes make sense. Possibly the temple at Ur has friezes depicting Nanna's roles?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_(mythology)
Nanna's wife was Ningal, his children Inanna and Utu

Nanna was associated with the moon, and he gave light during the night. He was also associated with cattle. Furthermore, he was often called upon to help childless couples get a child, and to help women in childbirth

Ur was written as 𒋀𒀕𒆠 (residence of Nanna)

Nanna is usually depicted as a crescent, facing upwards like a bull's horns. The crescent was compared to a barge sometimes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningublaga
Ningublaga was associated with cattle (who wasn't?)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numushda
Numushda was associated with flooding, potentially important in a coastal city like Ur

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningal
Ningal was Nanna's wife. She's been called "high lady", "lady, star of the prince", "sevenfold light" and "treasured". She may have been associated with birds? Maybe depicted as a seated woman next to a crescent

She had her own temples in Ur, called Egarku and Agrunku. The smaller shrines in the ziggurat enclosure probably were't for her? I'd expect they were for children or attendants of Nanna

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningikuga
In Old Babylonian times she was the mother of Ningal, although earlier sources seem to say Ningikuga was just another nane for Ningal. Ningikuga means "lady of the pure reeds" - perhaps Ningal was associated with the reeds around Ur, and the birds who lives within?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamash
Shamash was all-seeing. He was the divine judge, he watched over travellers, and he was associated with divination. The dawn goddess Sherida was his wife. Sherida may or may not have been worshipped in Ur in the Early Dynastic period?

A book that cites many of the claims for gender non-conforming people in Inanna's priesthood. The gala were people who were born as men but identified as women. They sang hymns in the Sumerian dialect known as eme-sal, which was usually used for goddesses

Explains how roles in society were linked to gender. The Creation of Man (2000 BCE) says that Ninmah created seven types of physically challenged persons, including "the woman who can not give birth" and "the one who has no male organ, no female organ". The sexless one "stands before the king", the role of the girsequ, while the barren woman becomes the prototype of the naditu priestesses. The later Akkadian myth of Atrahasis (1700 BCE) says that Enki instructed Nintu to create a "third-category among the people" that includes women who would not give birth, an infant-stealing demon, and the priestesses who are barred from giving birth. 

The Assyrians castrated claves to perform administrative roles, but that wasn't common before them

Sea Level Changes in the Mesopotamian Plain and Limits of the Arabian Gulf: A Critical Review
Discusses the sea level changes of the Persian Gulf. Basically a survey of other papers. There's not a ton of agreement. Archeologists talk about how the Euphrates and Tigirs delivered silt and filled in the Gulf, while geologists talk about how the melting ice sheets released a lot of water and _raised_ the sea level. There seems to be some consensus that Ur was on the coast arouhg 4500 years ago?

# Other Notes
Use the Sumerian name for the Euphrates! And try to learn some Sumerian cuneiform, or at least the major principles of it. The Ark Before Noah has a primer in its second chapter

Oil lamp U10565, called Oil Lamp A in my game files. Fron the Royal Cemetery of Ur, dating to EDIIIa. Make of copper

http://www.ur-online.org/subject/10796/
U10886

Similar to the above, but made of silver

Seems a little better preserved than U10565 - U10565 has a downward-bent spout, this one has the spout facing up. That seems more sensible to me, but I've never used an oil lamp lol

http://www.ur-online.org/subject/31477/
No U number? Similar oil lamp to the two above, made of copper and more tarnished than U10565. Looks to me to have almost exactly the same shape as the other two oil lamps. One might theorize that the people of Ur made a lot of lamps in the same shape, in lots of different materials. I should be safe to make these from clay

http://www.ur-online.org/subject/13286/
U12736
Copper oil lamp, same shape as others. Maybe a little more bent. Dates to EDIIIb - they loved this style of lamp

http://www.ur-online.org/subject/10121/
U10413
Copper oil lamp - in a different style! This one has a round bowl, not a shell-like one

http://www.ur-online.org/subject/10169/
U10451
Gold oil lamp, circular base. Very different from others

http://www.ur-online.org/subject/27239/
Copper cylinder - interpreted as either a vessel or a sheath for a furnature leg. Did they have copper things on the bottom of chair legs to protext them? Copper is pretty soft, these sheats might have only been needed for reeds?

http://www.ur-online.org/subject/28561/
Cup A - a clay cup, possibly spun or made of coiled clay? Similar shape to a lot of the metal cups found in the Royal Cemetery

http://www.ur-online.org/subject/33717/ 
Cup B - still clay, different shape

http://www.ur-online.org/subject/33742/
Cup C - yet another shape! Wow!

Some or all of these cups may date to different time periods. All well. Woolley did not document where he found these, so it's hard to say

This casts a lot of doubt on the existance of the First Dynasty of Ur lmao. It posits that the title "King of Kish" we see in a lot of rulers of Ur really referred to Uruk, that the kings of Uruk stled themselves as King of Kish. Kish was apparently metaphorical in this title?

This document is concerned with Ur, Uruk, Lagash, Umma, Adab, Kish, and Mari

A genetic study of Harappans, and other people, has yielded interesting information. The Harappan geneomes didnt't show any influence from Sumerians or other Mesopotamians, but there's a few individuals in Mesopotamia that are genetic outliers. Many of these people are burried with Harappan artifacts. This suggests that some people migrated to Mesopotamia and kept their culture with them
