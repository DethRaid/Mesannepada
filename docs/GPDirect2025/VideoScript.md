# Video Script

The video opens with a title screen. The first line of text fades in, then after a few seconds the second line of text fades in. The cuneiform is displayed with the English text

 𒐞               𒈗  𒀭𒄑𒉋𒂵𒎌         𒀕𒆠
600 years after  Lugal  Bilgames   ruled in Uruk...

 𒈗 𒈩𒀭𒉌𒅆𒊒𒁕         𒋀𒀕𒆠
Lugal  Mesannepada ruled in Ur

9 seconds

Cut to the main menu screen. MESANNEPADA is displayed at the top, with the cuneiform just above. I'll open the options menu and switch between FSR and DLSS, then save and start a new game. We'll fly in front of the temple and walk through the entryway. I should place some oil lamps and boxes around to make it look nicer...

I'll walk though, look at the temple, then turn left and walk into the baking area. Light streams out of the furnaces. I turn to look at once - and a guy is visible on the other side!

Cut to black

Then we'll go into features of the engine. Cut to the player arriving at the south harbor - I'll walk for a little bit, then stop and bring up the debug menu. I'll put a title on the screen like "Place objects in the environment!", then place a few boats and pottery nearby. I'll show a title card "Edit object properties!" and show off editing an object's Transform in the entity editor. I'll show a title car "Organize objects into scenes!" and show loading a scene called "gp_memes" - which of course has deccer's cubes and some froges

We can move to some renderer features. I'll cut back to the temple complex and stand inside a dark room. The title card "Dynamic lighting" leads to me adding a light to the room, then "...and dynamic GI!" and I slide a door shut to cut off the indirect lighting. "Ray tracing not required... but it is recommended" a view of a room with the LPV enabled, then a wipe to RT GI. "Skeletal animation" and the happy soldier doing a walkcycle. 

"Coming soon... Gameplay features!" and the camera looks at the happy soldier close up, making him look shocked (or paint a shocked face)

The video ends with a title card "MESANNEPADA" for one second, then "Coming 2026" for one second, then "𒆬𒈨𒉈𒁶" and a fade to black

# TODO
- Drag objects from the object selector into the scene
- ImGuizmo handles to move things around
- Edit object proeprties in the Entity editor - verify that it works
- Play skeletal animations
- Create GP Memes level - record yourself creating it to show off the tools?

"Heat from fire, fire from heat"
